## Main Features

The core feature of Kornu.
- **Universal Search:** Allows searching for a person using their Instagram username, full name, or phone number.
- **Detailed Results:** When performing a search, the application presents a complete profile that includes:
    - **Reputation Traffic Light:** A visual and intuitive system that classifies reputation in three levels:
        - 🟢 **Trustworthy:** Positive score, indicates good experiences.
        - 🟡 **Warning:** Slightly negative score, suggests caution.
        - 🔴 **High Risk:** Very negative score, indicates serious problems reported.
    - **Summary and Statistics:** Shows the total score, number of reviews, and a breakdown of positive vs. negative reports.
    - **Community Reviews:** List of all reviews submitted by other users.

### 2. Creating Reviews (Report)

    - `💔 Infidelity`
    - `💰 Theft`
    - `🔪 Betrayal`
    - `☢️ Toxicity`

- **Evidence Contribution:** Visual evidence can be attached to support the review. These are only visible to registered users.

## Advanced Features

### 1. Automated Web Research (AI)
When searching for a profile, Kornu performs an automatic web search to find presence on other platforms.
- **Social Media Search:** Verifies profiles on Google, Facebook, TikTok, etc.
- **Dating Site Search:** Simulates searches on platforms like Badoo and Tinder to detect possible profiles.
- **Specialized Search:** Includes verifications on sites like Skokka, OnlyFans, and Cafecito.app.

### 2. Instagram Profile Search
If no profile is found in the Kornu database, the application actively searches Instagram to find possible matches, showing their profile pictures and usernames so the user can verify.

### 3. AI Integration (Google Gemini)
Kornu uses Google AI to power several of its features.
- **Content Generator (AI Page):** A tool that allows searching for public news or events on the web (e.g., "celebrity breakups 2024"). The AI analyzes the results and generates draft reviews, extracting the name, country, a summary of the event, and a suggested category. These suggestions can be added to the platform with one click.
- **Avatar Generation:** Profile pictures for registered users are generated by AI (Imagen model) to create a unique and abstract avatar based on their initials, protecting their privacy.

### 4. Notification System
A real-time notification center to keep users informed.
- **Alerts:** Notifies about new reviews of relevant profiles or important updates.
- **Management:** Allows marking notifications as read, deleting them, and navigating directly to related content.

### 5. Dark / Light Theme
The interface has a theme selector so users can choose between a light mode and a dark mode, adapting to their preferences and improving visual accessibility.
